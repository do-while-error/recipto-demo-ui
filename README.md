Recipto Demo UI
Welcome to the Recipto Demo UI! This project showcases a beautifully designed mobile app interface built with Flutter and uses GetX for efficient state management. The code is organized following the MVC architecture and emphasizes clean, maintainable, and scalable practices.

‚ú® Features
State Management with GetX: Efficient state management with GetX, ensuring a smooth and reactive user experience. GetX helps with dependency injection, route management, and state control, making the app highly performant.

Beautiful UI: Crafted a clean and modern user interface (UI) to ensure an enjoyable user experience (UX). The design follows a minimalistic approach with attention to detail, ensuring both functionality and aesthetics.

MVC Architecture: The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, promoting a well-organized and maintainable structure. Each layer has a clear responsibility:

Model: Handles data and business logic.
View: Displays the UI.
Controller: Manages state and user interactions.
Clean Code Principles: The project adheres to SOLID principles, ensuring maintainable, readable, and reusable code. This helps in future-proofing the codebase for new features and optimizations.

Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes and orientations, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

Reusability: Modular components are designed for reuse, making it easy to extend or modify the project.

Scalable Structure: The project structure is scalable and ready for future features or enhancements.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Flutter: The framework used to build the UI with Dart.
GetX: For state management, route management, and dependency injection.
Dart: The programming language behind the app.
MVC Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns and clean code.
